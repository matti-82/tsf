# TSF - tab-structured file
TSF allows to save tree structures in text files, similar to XML. But TSF has a lower overhead and is easier to read and write. Each line has the format

    name^type=value

and parent-child-relations are represented by tabs. Each part is optional, e.g. you can write name=value, create a sub-section with name^type or write lists by writing
just the value in each line. The file generated by example.cpp looks like this:

    ^Person
    	firstName=Anton
    	lastName=Anders
    	birthday^Date
    		day=25
    		month=11
    		year=1982
    	friends=
    		Berta Bittrich
    		Carsten Claus
    ^Person
    	firstName=Daniel
    	lastName=Dietrich
    	birthday^Date
    		day=12
    		month=3
    		year=1995

## Planned Features
In future, it will be possible to specify the type of the root item or assign a value to it. To make the root item distinguishable from the 1st child item,
the type will be put in square brackets instead of putting ^ before, so that it will look a bit like an ini file. The root line will be optional, so that
TSF files created with the current version can still be read.
